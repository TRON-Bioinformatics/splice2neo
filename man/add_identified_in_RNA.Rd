\title{This is a wrapper function to directly map the information if a junction predicted from WES data was found in RNA-seq by leafcutter or spladder}
\usage{
add_identified_in_RNA(mutation_juncs, path_to_spladder, path_to_leafcutter)
}
\arguments{
\item{mutation_juncs}{The junction-transcript centric data predicted from WES data.}

\item{path_to_spladder}{The path to the results from RNA-seq analysis with spladder}

\item{path_to_leafcutter}{The path to the results from RNA-seq analysis with leafcutter}
}
\value{
The junction-transcript centric data predicted from WES data is extedended by the information if a respective aberrant junctions was
identified by spladder or leafcutter. (\code{identified_by_leafcutter}, \code{identified_by_spladder})
