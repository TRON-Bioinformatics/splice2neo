Description: This package provides functions for the analysis of alternative or 
 aberrant splicing junctions and their creation from or association with 
 somatic mutations. It integrates the output of several tools which predict 
 splicing effects from mutation or RNA-seq data into a common splice junction 
 format based on genomic coordinates. Splice junctions can be annotated with 
 affected transcript sequences, CDS, and resulting peptide sequences.
