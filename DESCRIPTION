Description: This package provides functions for analyzing alternative splicing 
 and aberrant splice junctions and their creation from or association with 
 somatic mutations. It integrates the output of several tools that predict 
 splicing effects from mutation or RNA-seq data into a unified splice junction 
 format. Splice junctions can be annotated with affected transcript sequences, 
 CDS, and resulting peptide sequences.
