## Installation

### Install this package from this GitLab

This R packge is not yet on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) or
[Biodonducotr](https://www.bioconductor.org/). Therefore, you have to install it
form this GitLap repository. 

However, this repository is a private GitLab reposoritory and therfore you have to 
create an personal access token (PAT) first. This is described [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html).
As Scope use `api` or `read_api`.  


``` r
install.packages("remotes") # if needed

remotes::install_gitlab("tron/splice2neo", host = "gitlab.rlp.net", auth_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN")

```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(splice2neo)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
