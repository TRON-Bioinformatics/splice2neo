We describe the framework MMSplice (modular modeling of splicing) with which we built the winning model of the CAGI5 exon skipping prediction challenge. The MMSplice modules are neural networks scoring exon, intron, and splice sites, trained on distinct large-scale genomics datasets. These modules are combined to predict effects of variants on exon skipping, splice site choice, splicing efficiency, and pathogenicity, with matched or higher performance than state-of-the-art. Our models, available in the repository Kipoi, apply to variants including indels directly from VCF files.},

	abstract = {Somatic mutations in cancer cells can generate tumour-specific neoepitopes, which are recognized by autologous T cells in the host. As neoepitopes are not subject to central immune tolerance and are not expressed in healthy tissues, they are attractive targets for therapeutic cancer vaccines. Because the vast majority of cancer mutations are unique to the individual patient, harnessing the full potential of this rich source of targets requires individualized treatment approaches. Many computational algorithms and machine-learning tools have been developed to identify mutations in sequence data, to prioritize those that are more likely to be recognized by T cells and to design tailored vaccines for every patient. In this Review, we fill the gaps between the understanding of basic mechanisms of T cell recognition of neoantigens and the computational approaches for discovery of somatic mutations and neoantigen prediction for cancer immunotherapy. We present a new classification of neoantigens, distinguishing between guarding, restrained and ignored neoantigens, based on how they confer proficient antitumour immunity in a given clinical context. Such context-based differentiation will contribute to a framework that connects neoantigen biology to the clinical setting and medical peculiarities of cancer, and will enable future neoantigen-based therapies to provide greater clinical benefit.},

Here, we present Pangolin, a deep learning model to predict splice site strength in multiple tissues. Pangolin outperforms state-of-the-art methods for predicting RNA splicing on a variety of prediction tasks. Pangolin improves prediction of the impact of genetic variants on RNA splicing, including common, rare, and lineage-specific genetic variation. In addition, Pangolin identifies loss-of-function mutations with high accuracy and recall, particularly for mutations that are not missense or nonsense, demonstrating remarkable potential for identifying pathogenic variants.},

	abstract = {Splicing is dysregulated in many tumors and may result in tumor-specific transcripts that can encode neoantigens, which are promising targets for cancer immunotherapy. Detecting tumor-specific splicing is challenging because many non-canonical splice junctions identified in tumor transcriptomes also appear in healthy tissues.
Here, we developed splice2neo to integrate the predicted splice effects from somatic mutations with splice junctions detected in tumor RNA-seq for individual cancer patients. Splice2neo excludes splice junctions from healthy tissue samples, annotates resulting transcript and peptide sequences, and provides targeted re-quantification of supporting RNA-seq reads. We developed a stringent detection rule to predict splice junctions as mutation-derived targets and identified 1.7 target splice junctions per tumor with a false discovery rate below 5\% in a melanoma cohort. We confirmed tumor-specificity using independent, healthy tissue samples. Furthermore, using tumor-derived RNA, we confirmed individual exon skipping events experimentally. Most target splice junctions encoded neoepitope candidates with predicted MHC-I or MHC-II binding. Compared to neoepitope candidates derived from non-synonymous point mutations, the splicing-derived MHC-I neoepitope candidates had a lower self-similarity to corresponding wild-type peptides.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that identifying mutation-derived and tumor-specific splice junctions can lead to additional neoantigen candidates to expand the target repertoire for cancer immunotherapies.
Key Pointssplice2neo is a versatile tool for identifying and analyzing of splice junctions as a source of neoantigen candidatesWe identified mutation-retrieved splice junctions supported by RNA-seq in melanoma samplesThe predicted target splice junctions exhibited a strong tumor-specificity as they were absent in healthy tissues.Target splice junctions often lead to frame-shift peptides and encode promising neoantigen candidates},
